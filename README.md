Brake LED Bar to get a sense of brake pedal pressure being applied

When switching between cars, it is tough to get your muscle memory reset.  This will accelerate that process for you.

As usual, download and unzip then move the folder with files into the C:\Program Files (x86)\SimHub\DashTemplates directory.

As you apply the brake pedal, the leds will climb the ladder changine colors as pressure is increased.
